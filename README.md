<p>Very Simple project for C++ beginner. A fastfood order and bill managment using file programming.<br>
There is additional 3 files you need for this program to run <a href="https://github.com/ShakilShaikh/FastFoodBillCPP/blob/master/Menu.loki"> Menu.loki</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShakilShaikh/FastFoodBillCPP/blob/master/Bills.loki">Bills.loki</a>,& <a href="https://github.com/ShakilShaikh/FastFoodBillCPP/blob/master/curr_id">curr_id</a>.<br>
In Menu.loki , there is price for item id in csv format. Our program will read the csv on start, then it will calculate the price based on user order.<br>
and it will save the order in Bills.loki, with the order id.</p>
